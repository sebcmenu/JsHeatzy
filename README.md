Standalone javascript application to programm Heatzy Pilote

Just checkout all the files to some directory, and open the Heatzy.html file in your favorite browser (it was tested on Chrome, should work flawlessly on Firefox, may work on IE/Edge - untested-).

Enter your heatzy account credential (NB : the credential are not stored anywhere in the application -and as a downside you'll have to type them everytime ou restart the page- and only send the Heatzy cloud API).

Once your device are loaded, go to ("select your zone") and start modify the planning of the selected device in the lower pane.

Do it for any device planning you want to modify.
When you are happy with the result, just use the Save button (red in the top righ corner of the screen, left of the filter dropdown). It will send your modifications to the Heatzy Cloud).
